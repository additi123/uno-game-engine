# UNO
This project is bassed on Object Oriented Programming. 

Uno is a game that consists of 108 cards and each player that plays starts off with 5 cards.
Depending on the card that is on top of the deck the player can either play with it's existing cards or has to draw 1 card if there are no other possible moves. 
There are certain special cards like skip which skips the turn of the next playing player. 
Then there is reverse which reverses the order of the flow of the next player.
There are wild cards which can be played anytime regardless of what card is on top of the deck. 
Wild cards can change the colour that needs to be played or can even draw 4 cards onto the next playing player. 
Lastly, draw two cards, draws two cards on the next playing player.
